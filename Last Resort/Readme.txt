== Problem Faced ==

This application is just a prototype of front end user interface. We faced the issues with backend connections with the remote server. We created different instances of Amazon Web Services like RDS and EC2. We also worked on LAMP and WAMP but faced problems in PHP connectivity and PHP-MySQL Connection. We also tried to to user Json technology to parse Json object returned by from Php.

Along With this file We are providing all Php files we created to communicate with the remote server.
